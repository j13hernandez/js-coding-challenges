/*
A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Have the function digitalRoot take a number as an argument and return the sum.
If that value has two digits, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit
number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

16 =
1 + 6
7

942 =
= 9 + 4 + 2
= 15 ...
= 1 + 5
